# Typescript weatherapp

<h1>React weather app</h1>

This react weather app is a way for me to test out react using typescript

in order to use it you need to enter the name of the city that you would like and the weather for the next 5 days will show up.

initally one weather "status" will show up and you can click and drag to look at the others, or click on the little dots to check any other ones
